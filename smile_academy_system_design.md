# Smile Academy System Design

## Implementation Approach

### Tech Stack Selection
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (primary) and Redis (caching)
- Real-time Communication: WebRTC with WebSocket (Socket.io)
- File Storage: AWS S3
- Authentication: JWT with OAuth2.0
- Video Streaming: Agora.io SDK

### Key Open Source Libraries
- express.js: Web framework
- mongoose: MongoDB ODM
- socket.io: Real-time communication
- agora-rtc-sdk: Video conferencing
- jsonwebtoken: Authentication
- aws-sdk: S3 integration
- bull: Job queue for notifications and analytics
- jest: Testing framework

### Security Considerations
1. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - OAuth2.0 for social logins
   - Session management with Redis

2. Data Security
   - End-to-end encryption for video streams
   - Data encryption at rest
   - HTTPS/TLS for all communications
   - Regular security audits

3. Compliance
   - GDPR compliance
   - COPPA compliance for children's data
   - Regular data backups
   - Data retention policies

### Scalability Plan
1. Horizontal Scaling
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
   - Microservices architecture for key components

2. Performance Optimization
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - CDN for static content delivery
   - Load balancing with nginx
   - Database sharding for large datasets

3. Monitoring and Maintenance
   - ELK stack for logging
   - Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring
   - Automated CI/CD pipeline
   - Regular performance testing

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Data retention requirements and compliance needs for different regions
2. Maximum concurrent users expected in virtual classrooms
3. Specific third-party integrations required for launch
4. Detailed backup and disaster recovery requirements
